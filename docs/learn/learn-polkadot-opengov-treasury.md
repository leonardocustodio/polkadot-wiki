The Treasury is a pot of funds collected through a portion of block production rewards, transaction
fees, slashing, and [staking inefficiencies](./learn-inflation.md).Treasury funds are held in a
[system account](./learn-account-advanced.md#system-accounts) that cannot be controlled by any
external account; only the system internal logic can access it.

:::tip Creating a Treasury Proposal on Polkadot OpenGov

If you would like to create a treasury proposal on Polkadot OpenGov, follow the instructions
outlined on [this how-to guide](./learn-guides-treasury#creating-a-treasury-proposal).

## Treasury Inflow and Outflow

Tokens that are deposited into the Treasury (i.e. the inflow) is determined by the following
mechanisms:

- **Transaction fees:** 80% of the transaction fees of every submitted extrinsic is diverted to the
  Treasury, while 20% is given to the block producers.
- **Staking inefficiencies:** the network knows an exogenously determined parameter called ideal
  staking rate. The APY for stakers (nominators & validators) decreases whenever the actual staking
  rate is not equal to the ideal staking rate. To keep inflation constant at 10%, the system does
  not creates less tokens, rather some share of the overall reward for stakers is diverted to the
  Treasury (more information
  [here](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/overview/token-economics)).
- **Slashes:** whenever validators and nominators are slashed, a share of the slashed tokens are
  diverted to Treasury. They are typically rare and unpredictable events.
- **Transfers:** everyone can send funds to the Treasury directly. This is a rare event and
  typically due to grantees reimbursing some of the amount they got allocated for various reasons.

The outflow is determined by the following mechanisms:

- **Burned tokens:** at the end of each spend period
  {{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.treasury.burn" defaultValue={10000} filter="permillToPercent"/> :polkadot }}{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.treasury.burn" defaultValue={2000} filter="permillToPercent"/> :kusama }}%
  of the available funds are burned.
- **Treasury proposals & Bounties:** they make up the largest share of outflow tokens to the
  community and need to be approved by governance. Then, payouts occur at the end of a
  [spend period](../general/glossary.md#spend-period).
- **Tips:** smaller payouts directly to grantees that can happen within a
  [spend period](../general/glossary.md#spend-period).

## Treasury Tracks

OpenGov allows for managing funds through six tracks, each with its own
[origin and track parameters](../maintain/maintain-guides-polkadot-opengov.md#origins-and-tracks-info).

- Treasurer
- Big Spender
- Medium Spender
- Small Spender
- Big Tipper
- Small Tipper

:::info How to access Treasury funds?

Access to Treasury funds requires successful enactment of referendum in the respective treasury
track on-chain. Learn how to submit a treasury proposal for referendum
[here](./learn-guides-treasury#creating-a-treasury-proposal).

:::

### Treasurer

This track can be used for treasury spending requests up to
{{ polkadot: 10M DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  333333.33 KSM  :kusama }} per referendum. Each
referendum requires a decision deposit of
{{ polkadot: 1000 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  33.33 KSM  :kusama }}.

### Big Spender

This track can be used for treasury spending requests up to
{{ polkadot: 1M DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  33333.33 KSM  :kusama }} per referendum. Each referendum
requires a decision deposit of {{ polkadot: 400 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  13.33 KSM  :kusama }}.

### Medium Spender

This track can be used for treasury spending requests up to
{{ polkadot: 100K DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  3333.33 KSM  :kusama }} per referendum. Each

## Bounties

:::info Bounty Guides

See the [bounty guides](./learn-guides-bounties.md) to learn about how to
[create a bounty](./learn-guides-bounties.md#submit-a-bounty-proposal),
[assign a curator](./learn-guides-bounties.md#assign-a-curator-to-a-bounty) to a bounty, as well as
[creating, awarding](./learn-guides-bounties.md#create-and-award-child-bounties) and
[claiming child bounties](./learn-guides-bounties.md#claim-a-child-bounty-reward).

### Parent Bounties

There are practical limits to Council Members curation capabilities when it comes to treasury
proposals: Council members likely do not have the expertise to make a proper assessment of the
activities described in all proposals. Even if individual Councillors have that expertise, it is
highly unlikely that a majority of members are capable in such diverse topics.

Bounties Spending proposals aim to delegate the curation activity of spending proposals to experts
called Curators: They can be defined as addresses with agency over a portion of the Treasury with
the goal of fixing a bug or vulnerability, developing a strategy, or monitoring a set of tasks
related to a specific topic: all for the benefit of the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem.

A proposer can submit a bounty proposal for the Council to pass, with a curator to be defined later,
whose background and expertise is such that they are capable of determining when the task is
complete. Curators are selected by the Council after the bounty proposal passes, and need to add an
upfront payment to take the position. This deposit can be used to punish them if they act
maliciously. However, if they are successful in their task of getting someone to complete the bounty
work, they will receive their deposit back and part of the bounty reward.

When submitting the value of the bounty, the proposer includes a reward for curators willing to
invest their time and expertise in the task: this amount is included in the total value of the
bounty. In this sense, the curator's fee can be defined as the result of subtracting the value paid
to the bounty rewardee from the total value of the bounty.

In general terms, curators are expected to have a well-balanced track record related to the issues
the bounty tries to resolve: they should be at least knowledgeable on the topics the bounty touches,
and show project management skills or experience. These recommendations ensure an effective use of
the mechanism. A Bounty Spending is a reward for a specified body of work - or specified set of
objectives - that needs to be executed for a predefined treasury amount to be paid out. The
responsibility of assigning a payout address once the specified set of objectives is completed is
delegated to the curator.

After the Council has activated a bounty, it delegates the work that requires expertise to the
curator who gets to close the active bounty. Closing the active bounty enacts a delayed payout to
the payout address and a payout of the curator fee. The delay phase allows the Council to act if any
issues arise.

To minimize storage on chain in the same way as any proposal, bounties don't contain contextual
information. When a user submits a bounty spending proposal, they will probably need to find an
off-chain way to explain the proposal (any of the available community forums serve this purpose).
[This template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-IBz_owspV5OcvezWXpksWDQReWowschD0TFuaVKKcU/edit?usp=sharing)
can help as a checklist of all needed information for the Council to make an informed decision.

The bounty has a predetermined duration of 90 days with the possibility of being extended by the
curator. Aiming to maintain flexibility on the tasksâ€™ curation, the curator will be able to create
sub-bounties for more granularity and allocation in the next iteration of the mechanism.
